# Flutter Chat

This is a simple chat app written in Flutter with Firestore backend.

It was created during Flutter Warsaw workshop #1 on March 23, 2019.

## Getting Started

This project uses Firebase and Firestore to work.

Please run `flutter upgrade` before. The project was developed with Flutter 1.3.8 initially.

# Part 1

At this point you have a simple one page app with Firebase and other small details preconfigured like file structure or required packages and plugins.

In this part we're going to write a basic login page `login_page.dart` and layout of `chat_rooms_page.dart`.
